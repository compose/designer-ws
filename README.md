Design Work Sample
===============================

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to design a landing page for [Pied Piper](http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley) — everyone’s favorite fictional startup. We’ve provided content, basic markup, as well as assets to get you started.

### Things to Know

* You can modify all markup to your heart’s content.
* All assets can be modified, substituted, or supplemented — even the logo. Go wild.
* This project will in no way be used by anyone, ever, and completely belongs to you (and HBO).

## Work Sample

* Design and implement a landing page using HTML, CSS, and optionally Javascript. The main goal for this landing page is to create brand awareness for Pied Piper, as well as convince potential customers to become actual customers.
