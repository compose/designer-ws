Designer Work Sample
====================

Design and implement a landing page for [Pied Piper](http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley) — everyone’s favorite fictional startup — using HTML, CSS, and (optionally) JavaScript. The goals for this landing page are to create brand awareness and convince potential customers to become actual customers.

#### Things to Know

* We’ve provided content, basic markup, as well as assets to get you started.
* All content must remain intact, but all markup can be modified, substituted, or supplemented.
* All assets can be modified, substituted, or supplemented — even the logo. Go wild.
* This project will in no way be used by anyone, ever, and completely belongs to you (and HBO).

#### Getting Started

* [Download this project](https://github.com/compose/designer-ws/archive/master.zip) or fork it if you prefer.
* Use voodoo, magic, or telepathy to complete and implement your design.
* Zip up your source files and submit them through Compose’s [application site](https://jobs.compose.io/jobs/openings/designer).
