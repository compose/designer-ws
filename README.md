Design Work Sample
==================

Design and implement a landing page for [Pied Piper](http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley) — everyone’s favorite fictional startup — using HTML, CSS, and optionally Javascript. The main goal for this landing page is to create brand awareness for Pied Piper, as well as convince potential customers to become actual customers. We’ve provided content, basic markup, as well as assets to get you started.

#### Things to Know

* All content must remain intact, but all markup can be modified, substituted, or supplemented.
* All assets can be modified, substituted, or supplemented — even the logo. Go wild.
* This project will in no way be used by anyone, ever, and completely belongs to you (and HBO).
