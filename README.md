Designer Work Sample
====================

Design and implement a landing page for [Pied Piper](http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley) — everyone’s favorite fictional startup — using HTML, CSS, and (optionally) JavaScript. The goals for this landing page are to create brand awareness and convince potential customers to become actual customers.
